PeXPloit v1.0 Source Code Compiled Using VS 2012/2013
PeXploit v1.0
Well here you go PeXPloit v1.0 Source Code No Advanced Window Yet

Enjoy

a Few Notes

//In Debug Folder
there are a few files needed to make pexploit work like a charm
*PS3DB - This Little File Is Used To Check From Yutolio's DB which file
should have edat's placed in there root folders and not in exdata (non
C00)
*edat_license.exe - This App is included but no longer used as this is
handeled in code
*db.err - create trick provided to auto rebuild database after injection
is completed

//In this version i did not work with idps.bin so everything is similar
to pexploit lite exept the advanced window would have changed that

Enjoy
